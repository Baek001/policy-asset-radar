# Reference Site Analysis (news.gqai.kr/dashboard)

## Snapshot (2026-02-15)
- Landing/dashboard appears content-first with card-based blocks and fast scan layout.
- Visual pattern emphasizes concise blocks, loading skeletons, and high-density summary widgets.
- Suitable takeaways for PPulse: top summary strip, compact cards, clear hierarchy for key metrics.

## Elements to Borrow
1. Top-priority summary section before feed list.
2. Compact card grid for key signals.
3. Consistent skeleton loading and spacing rhythm.

## Elements to Avoid
1. Overly generic news feed without personal relevance.
2. Long text blocks that reduce scan speed.

## Immediate PPulse Mapping
- Top: super-issue x3
- Mid: user-interest impact summary (item-level)
- Bottom: same-day event feed with reason chips
